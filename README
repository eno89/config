This repository contains my configuration files for various softwares.


To make a package for specific stuffs (or, more precise, to extract
specific stuffs from this repository), use the following command:

  $ make PACKAGE_NAME={package_name} [PACKAGE_TYPE={archive_type}] package

Where {package_name} is one of the strings listed in ALL_PACKAGES,
and {archive_type} is one of the strings listed in ALL_PACKAGE_TYPES.
See Makefile for the detail of ALL_PACKAGES and ALL_PACKAGE_TYPES.
For example:

  $ make PACKAGE_NAME=vim-textobj-user package

The above command makes vim-textobj-user-{version}.tar.bz2 which
contains files and directories related to textobj-user, a Vim plugin.
