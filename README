You can easily extract (or, more precise, make a package for) specific stuffs
from this repository with the following command:

    $ make PACKAGE_NAME={package_name} [PACKAGE_TYPE={archive_type}] package

Where {package_name} is one of the strings listed in ALL_PACKAGES,
and {archive_type} is one of the strings listed in ALL_PACKAGE_TYPES.
See Makefile for the detail of ALL_PACKAGES and ALL_PACKAGE_TYPES.
For example:
