==============================================================================
INTRODUCTION					*altftsys-introduction*

*altftsys* is a filetype scripts loader which is alternative to the default
one.  The goal of altftsys is to easily write filetype scripts and to easily
configure filetype-specific settings.

Requirements:
- Vim 7.2 or later




==============================================================================
TERMS						*altftsys-terms*

Simple filetype					*simple-filetype*
			A value of 'filetype' which doesn't contain any dot.

Compound filetype				*compound-filetype*
			A value of 'filetype' which contains multiple
			filetypes separated by dot.

Base filetype plugins				*base-filetype-plugin*
			Filetype plugins which do basic settings for specific
			filetype.  Their names are:
			
				ftplugin/{filetype}.vim

			and they are not located in |after-directory|.

Additional filetype plugins			*additional-filetype-plugin*
			Filetype plugins which do additional settings for
			specific filetype.  Their names are one of the
			followings:

				after/ftplugin/{filetype}.vim
				after/ftplugin/{filetype}_{name}.vim
				after/ftplugin/{filetype}/{name}.vim

FILETYPE PLUGINS				*altftsys-ftplugin*

LOADING ~

Base filetype plugins
			Loading process is like the default one, but the
			following points are differed:

			- Only the first found file is sourced.

			- Only "ftplugin/{filetype}.vim" will be searched,
			  i.e., "ftplugin/{filetype}_{name}.vim" and
			  "ftplugin/{filetype}/{name}.vim" will not be
			  searched.

			- Files in |after-directory| will not be searched.

			- Before load a filetype plugin, the values of
			  b:did_ftplugin and b:undo_ftplugin are saved, then
			  :unlet them.

			- After loading a filetype plugin, the values of
			  b:did_ftplugin and b:undo_ftplugin are merged with
			  the previously saved values.

Additional filetype plugins
			Loading process is like the default one, but the
			following points are differed:

			- Only files in |after-directory| will be searched.

			- Before loading a filetype plugin, the value of
			  b:undo_ftplugin is saved, then :unlet it.

			- After loading a filetype plugin, the value of
			  b:undo_ftplugin is merged with the previously saved
			  value.

WRITING A FILETYPE PLUGIN ~

Base filetype plugins
			As same as the standard one.
			See |write-filetype-plugin| for the detail.

Additional filetype plugins
			Like base filetype plugins, but you don't have to
			check and set b:did_ftplugin.  It's unnecessary.

The merits to use altftsys are:
- Support for compound filetype.
- Easy to write/use additional filetype plugins.

With the default loader, it's troublesome to deal with b:did_ftplugin and
b:undo_ftplugin in the both cases.  Now you don't have to care about them.
