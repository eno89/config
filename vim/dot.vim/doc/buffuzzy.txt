==============================================================================
INTRODUCTION						*buffuzzy-introduction*

buffuzzy is a Vim plugin to provide alternate way to select buffer
with automatic and fuzzy completion.

To start buffer selection, use the following commands or key mappings:

:Buffuzzy[!]						*:Buffuzzy*
			Start buffer selection.  After selection, switch to
			the selected buffer by |:buffer|.

			:Buffuzzy! is same as :Buffuzzy but use :buffer! to
			switch to the selected buffer.

<Plug>Buffuzzy						*<Plug>Buffuzzy*
			Execute |:Buffuzzy|.

<Leader>b						*<Leader>b*
			Mapped to |<Plug>Buffuzzy|.
			NOTE: This mapping will not be defined when this key
			sequence is already mapped to something or
			|<Plug>Buffuzzy| is already mapped from something.




==============================================================================
BUFFER SELECTION WINDOW					*buffuzzy-window*

As buffer selection starts, a new window called "buffer selection window" is
opened on the top, the cursor is moved to it, then switch to Insert mode.

The content of the buffer selection window is treated as patterns to specify
which buffer to switch (see |buffuzzy-patterns| for the detail) .  If the name
of a buffer is matched with the patterns, the buffer is treated as a candidate.
For each time you insert a character in the buffer selection window, candidate
buffers will be listed in the popup menu.

In the buffer selection window, the following key mappings are available:

<C-c>							*<C-c>* *i_<C-c>*
			Stop buffer selection.  Close the buffer selection
			window, then move the cursor to the previously active
			window.

<Return>						*<Return>* *i_<Return>*
			Switch to the selected buffer or the most appropriate
			buffer for the given pattern.

			If more than one buffers are matched with the pattern,
			switch to the buffer with the lowest number (i.e. the
			first buffer you opened.)

o		or					*o* *<C-o>* *i_<C-o>*
<C-o>			|:split|, then switch to the selected buffer.

v		or					*v* *<C-v>* *i_<C-v>*
<C-v>			|:vsplit|, then switch to the selected buffer.




==============================================================================
PATTERNS TO SELECT BUFFER				*buffuzzy-patterns*

A pattern consists one or more words, and a word

(A) consits of any characters but a space, tab and slash;

(B) or consists of one slash.


Pattern matching is done as follows:

1. Let a buffer name to be compared is S
   and a pattern consists of the words w1, w2, ..., wN.

2. Check whether w1 appears in S or not.
   If it appears, check whether w2 appears in S and after w1.
   Repeat same checking for w3, w4, ..., wN.

   If one of the words is a slash, no slash appears between w(I-1) and w(I)
   for all words w(I) after a slash word,

3. If all words appear in this order, S is matched.
   Otherwise S is not matched.


For example:

- "b" matches "buffuzzy.txt" and "buffuzzy.vim".

- "b t" matches "buffuzzy.txt" but doesn't match "buffuzzy.vim".

- "f/" matches "ftplugin/foo.vim" and "after/ftplugin/foo.vim".

- "f/." matches "ftplugin/foo.vim" but doesn't match "after/ftplugin/foo.vim".
