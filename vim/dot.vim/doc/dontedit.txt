==============================================================================
INTRODUCTION					*dontedit-introduction*

*dontedit* is a Vim plugin to provide a safety net for files which should not
be edited manually.  For example, if you edit automatically generated files
by mistake, then you'll get involved some troubles.  This plugin detects such
situations and set a few options to protect editing.


Requirements:
- Vim 7.2 or later

Latest version:
http://github.com/kana/config/commits/vim-dontedit




==============================================================================
CONFIGURATION					*dontedit-configuration*

g:dontedit_content_patterns			*g:dontedit_content_patterns*
	A list of |pattern|s.  Whenever you start to edit a file, this plugin
	checks whether any of the patterns is matched to the content of the
	file.  If so, this plugin recognizes the file not to be edited
	manually.

	The default value is as follows: >
		['\c\<\%(do not\|don''t\) edit this file manually\>']
<




==============================================================================
BUGS						*dontedit-bugs*

- The way to detect files which should not be edited is ad hoc, and the
  default values of |dontedit-configuration| are not mature.  Please give me
  a feedback if you have more suitable ways and/or configurations.
