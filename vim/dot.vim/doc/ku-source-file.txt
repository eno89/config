INTRODUCTION				       *ku-source-file-introduction*

*ku-source-file* is a source for Vim plugin |ku| to deal with files and
directories.  You can choose one from many files, directories and contents in
archive files, then do some action on it.


Requirements:
- Vim 7.2 or later
- |ku| 0.3.0 or later (vimscript#2337)
- Zip archive explorer v17 or later (|pi_zip.txt|, included with Vim)

Latest version:
http://github.com/kana/config/commits/vim-ku-source-file

INTERFACE					*ku-source-file-interface*

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ACTION TABLLE				       *ku-source-file-action-table*

See also:
- |ku-common-action-table|
- |ku-source-buffer-action-table|

Additionally, the following actions are available:

open						*ku-source-file-action-open*
			Do |:edit| the file/directory corresponding to a given
			candidate.  If a buffer corresponding to the
			file/directory exists, |:buffer| is used instead.

open!						*ku-source-file-action-open!*
			Like "open", but use :edit! or :buffer! instead.

ACTIONS FOR ARCHIVE CONTENT		 *ku-source-file-action-table-archive*

extract-asis				  *ku-source-file-aciton-extract-asis*
			Extract the archive or the file an archive
			corresponding to a given candidate, with the same
			directory structure in the archive.

extract-smartly			       *ku-source-file-aciton-extract-smartly*
			Like "extract-asis", but create a directory which name
			is the same as the basename of an archive if the
			archive doesn't contain such directory for all of its
			content, then extract some content into the directory.

extract-solely				*ku-source-file-aciton-extract-solely*
			Like "extract-asis", but extract content without any
			directory structure in the archive.  This action is
			only available for candidates which are corresponding
			to archive files.

Example of "extract-*" actions ~

In the following table,
"a.zip" is an archive file which contains "a/foo.txt",
"b.zip" is an archive file which contains "bar.txt", and
"c.zip" is an archive file which contains "d/baz.txt".

          |                  Extracted stuff                ~
Candidate |------------------------------------------------ ~
          | extract-asis     extract-smartly extract-solely ~
----------------------------------------------------------- ~
a.zip       a/foo.txt        a/foo.txt       foo.txt
b.zip       bar.txt          b/bar.txt       bar.txt
c.zip       d/baz.txt        c/d/baz.txt     baz.txt


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
KEY TABLE					*ku-source-file-key-table*

See also:
- |ku-common-key-table|
- |ku-source-buffer-key-table|

Key		Action ~
--------	--------
<C-e>		extract-smartly	|ku-source-file-action-extract-smartly|
<Esc>e		extract-solely	|ku-source-file-action-extract-solely|
E		extract-asis	|ku-source-file-action-extract-asis|
e		extract-smartly	|ku-source-file-action-extract-smartly|


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
KINDS						*ku-source-file-kinds*

Each candidate from |ku-source-file| can be treated as a buffer if such buffer
already exists.  See also |ku-source-buffer|.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ARCHIVES					*ku-source-file-archives*

|ku-source-file| list contents of archive files like files in directories.
For example, as you input "dir/" in |the-ku-buffer|, ku will list files and
directories in the directory "dir".  Like this, as you input "foo.zip/" in the
ku buffer, ku will list files and directories in the archive file "foo.zip".
If "foo.zip" contains "README.txt", "Makefile" and "bar.c", ku will list them
as follows:
>
	Source: file
	>foo.zip/
	foo.zip/Makefile
	foo.zip/README.txt
	foo.zip/bar.c
<
You can do some action on such candidates.  For example, if you do "open" on
"foo.zip/bar.c", the content of "bar.c" in "foo.zip" will be displayed in
a the current window.

					      *ku-source-file-archive-formats*
Currently, the following formats are supported:
- .zip


See also |ku-source-file-action-table-archive| for additional actions for
candidates corresponding to archive files.

See also |ku-source-file-bugs| for limitations.




==============================================================================
BUGS						*ku-source-file-bugs*

KNOWN ISSUES ~

- ".." for the root directory should not be listed.  But on Microsoft Windows,
  ".." is also listed for (each) root directory in some situations.

- |ku-source-file-archives| feature is currently disabled.

- Actions specific to archive files or content of archive files should be
  available only for such candidates.  But |<Plug>(ku-choose-action)| lists
  the actions for all candidates.

  Currently, the actions do nothing for improper candidates.

- Recursive archive files are not supported.  This means that archive files
  which are contained in another archive file are not treated specially.  For
  example, if there is "a.zip" which contains "b.zip" and "b.zip" contains
  "c.txt", you can choose "b.zip" with some patterns such as "a.zip/b.zip",
  but you cannot choose "c.txt" with any pattern such as "a.zip/b.zip/c.txt".


PLANNED FEATURES ~

- More actions: "remove", "remove!", "rename", ...

- List files/directories recursively.  Currently |ku-source-file| lists
  files/directories only in a directory.

- Increase performance for many files/directories.

- Support the following archive formats (via standard plugings):
  - .Z
  - .bz2
  - .gz
  - .tar
  - .tar.Z
  - .tar.bz2
  - .tar.gz

- Support more archive formats (via |metarw|, vimscript#2335)

- "Learn" correspondence of archive formats and extensions.
  For example: ".zip and .jar are zip archives", etc.

CHANGELOG					*ku-file-changelog*

0.2.0	2009-10-24T22:54:06+09:00	      *ku-source-file-changelog-0.2.0*
	- Update for ku 0.3.0.

0.1.4	2009-05-29T09:11:39+09:00	      *ku-source-file-changelog-0.1.4*
	Bug fixes:
	- Fix a bug that it is not possible to list the contents in the most
	  of absolute paths.  This bug was mixed in version 0.1.3.

	  Thanks to Travis Jeffery for a feedback.  I noticed this bug by the
	  feedback, though it doesn't imply this bug.

0.1.3	2009-05-24T15:57:13+09:00	      *ku-source-file-changelog-0.1.3*
	Feature enhancements:
	- Support to deal with files in an archive files.  See also
	  |ku-file-archives| for the details.

0.1.2	2009-05-13T22:33:46+09:00	      *ku-source-file-changelog-0.1.2*
	Bug fixes:
	- Fix an assumption that the separator for pathes is "/".  This
	  assumption causes unexpected behavior on some environments such as
	  Microsoft Windows.
	- Fix a bug that dot files are not listed on Microsoft Windows.
	  Thanks to thinca for reporting this.
	- Fix a bug that directories are suffixed with a path separator
	  unexpectedly if some condition is met.  It is somewhat inconvenient
	  with |ku-auto-component-completion|.
	- Don't list ".." for the root directory.  This is not worked for
	  Microsoft Windows yet.
	- Fix a bug that |ku-file-action-open| and |ku-file-action-open!|
	  don't escape a given path properly.  Thanks to thinca for reporting
	  this.

	Feature enhancements:
	- In the |ins-completion-menu|, append a path separator for each item
	  which is a directory to clear whether an item is a directory or not.
	  This appending only affects the menu, and internal data are not
	  always suffixed with a path separator.

	Incompatible changes:
	- Require ku 0.2.2.

0.1.1	2009-05-04T01:45:44+09:00	      *ku-source-file-changelog-0.1.1*
	- Update for ku 0.2.1.

0.1.0	2009-04-28T02:00:05+09:00	      *ku-source-file-changelog-0.1.0*
	- Update for ku 0.2.0.

0.0.2	2008-12-24T14:08:50+09:00	      *ku-source-file-changelog-0.0.2*
	- Fix the bug that a file or a directory which path contains a space
	  cannot be correctly opened.

0.0.1	2008-09-29T02:42:28+09:00	      *ku-source-file-changelog-0.0.1*
	- Filter items for |ku-auto-component-completion|.  Only directories
	  are completed.
	- List dot files if the last part of an input pattern starts with
	  a dot, for example, ".a", "b/c/.d" and so forth.
	- Fix the bug that parent directories are not listed.

0.0.0	2008-07-20T01:10:37+09:00	      *ku-source-file-changelog-0.0.0*
	- Initial version.
