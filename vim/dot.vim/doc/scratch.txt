==============================================================================
KEY MAPPINGS						*scratch-mappings*

Any key mapping that don't start with <Plug> will not be defined if its {lhs}
is already mapped to something or its {rhs} is already mapped from something.


Scratch buffer local:

CTRL-J		or					*CTRL-J*
CTRL-M		or					*CTRL-M* *<CR>*
<CR>			Mapped to |<Plug>Scratch_ExecuteLine|.

{Visual}CTRL-J	or					*v_CTRL-J*
{Visual}CTRL-M	or					*v_CTRL-M* *v_<CR>*
{Visual}<CR>		Mapped to |<Plug>Scratch_ExecuteSelection|.


Global:

<Leader>s
			Mapped to |<Plug>Scratch_Open|.

							*<Plug>Scratch_Open*
<Plug>Scratch_Open	``Open'' the scratch buffer, i.e., create the buffer
			if it does not exist, show if it is not visible, or
			move the cursor to the window that shows it.

						*<Plug>Scratch_ExecuteLine*
<Plug>Scratch_ExecuteLine
			Execute the current line as a Vim script, then move
			the cursor to the first non-blank character of the
			next line.  If there is no more line, add one more
			line and move the cursor to there.

					*<Plug>Scratch_ExecuteSelection*
<Plug>Scratch_ExecuteSelection
			Same as |<Plug>Scratch_ExecuteLine|, but execute the
			highlighted text.



==============================================================================
CUSTOMIZING						*scratch-customizing*


VARIABLES						*scratch-variables*

							*g:scratch_buffer_name*
g:scratch_buffer_name   string (default: '*Scratch*')
	The name of the scratch buffer.  Set this value before this plugin is
	loaded (e.g. $MYVIMRC).

						      *g:scratch_show_command*
g:scratch_show_command  string (default: 'topleft split | hide buffer')
	The command to show the scratch buffer.  When this plugin shows the
	scratch buffer, it will execute the following script: >

	execute g:scratch_show_command the_buffer_number_of_the_scratch_buffer
<

	Examples:

	'topleft split | hide buffer' (default value)
		Create new window at the top and show in it.
	'hide buffer'
		Show in the active window.


INITIALIZATION						*scratch-init*

When the scratch buffer is created, an event will be triggered to initialize
it.  If you want to add and/or override the default settings, use |autocmd|
like the following: >
	augroup Scratch
	  autocmd User Initialize <any commands to initialize ...>
	augroup END
<
The default settings are:
- set 'filetype' as vim.  (if 'filetype' is not set)
- put some informative message.  (if 'filetype' is vim)
- define several buffer-local key mappings.
