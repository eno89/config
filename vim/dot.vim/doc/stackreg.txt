INTRODUCTION					*stackreg-introduction*

*stackreg* is a Vim plugin to provide stackable registers.  If you delete or
yank a text without specifying a register, the text will be pushed into
a stack.  If you put without specifying a register, a text will be popped from
the stack then it will be put.

The concept of stackable registers is derived from Vz which is an editor for
MS-DOS and it was widely used in Japan since 1989.

Requirements:
- Vim 7.2 or later
- |advice| 0.0.0 or later (vimscript#...)

					  *g:stackreg_no_default_key_mappings*
						*:StackregDefaultKeyMappings*
The above key mappings are defined by the default.  If you don't want to
define them, define |g:stackreg_no_default_key_mappings| before this plugin is
loaded (e.g. in your |vimrc|).  You can also use |:StackregDefaultKeyMappings|
to redefine these key mappings.  This command doesn't override existing {lhs}s
unless [!] is given.

To disable advices defined by stackreg, use the following command:
>
	call advice#disable_pattern('^stackreg$')
<
