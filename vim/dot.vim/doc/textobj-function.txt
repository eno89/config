INTERFACE					*textobj-function-interface*

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
KEY MAPPINGS					*textobj-function-key-mappings*


In visual mode or operator-pending mode, the following text objects are
available.  Note that the fllowing mappings will not be defined when its {lhs}
is already mapped.

af						*af* *o_af* *v_af*
			``a function'', select the all range of a function.

if						*if* *o_if* *v_if*
			``inner function'', select the body of a function,
			other parts of a function are not included e.g. its
			name, its arguments and so forth).


For customization, the follownig mappings are available.

<Plug>TOFunc_A					*<Plug>TOFunc_A*
			``a function''.

<Plug>TOFunc_I					*<Plug>TOFunc_I*
			``inner function''.




==============================================================================
CUSTOMIZING					*textobj-function-customizing*

TOFunc uses the following functions to get the appropriate range of a function
for the current 'filetype'.  See ftplugin/*_textobj-function.vim in the archive of
TOFunc for examples.

g:TOFunc[&filetye].GetRangeA()			*textobj-function-GetRangeA()*
			Like |GetRangeI()|, but returns the range of ``a
			function''.

g:TOFunc[&filetye].GetRangeI()			*textobj-function-GetRangeI()*
			Returns the range of ``inner function''.  The return
			value is [b, e], where b is the beginning position and
			e is the end position of the range.  The detail of
			both values are same as |getpos()|. If there is no
			appropriate function, this function must return 0.

			Moving the cursor is allowed, but it is restored
			afterwards.




==============================================================================
BUGS						*textobj-function-bugs*

- There are many bugs around the world.




==============================================================================
CHANGELOG					*textobj-function-changelog*

0.1.0	2009-04-25T14:17:41+09:00
	- Rename the name of this plugin as textobj-function.  The old name is
	  tofunc and it's not clear to indicate what this plugin does.
	- Change the locations of sample scripts to use textobj-function.  Old
	  version put the scripts in after/ftplugin.  Now the scripts are put
	  in ftplugin.  Because there is no reason to put the scripts in
	  after/ftplugin and it may disturb users to override the sample
	  scripts with their own ones.

0.0	2007-XX-XX
	- Initial version.
